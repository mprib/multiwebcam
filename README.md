## *Synchronized webcam recording for bootstrapping low-cost/early-stage computer vision projects*

</div>

# What it does

Records synchronized frames from multiple webcams, including frame-by-frame time stamp history, real time synchronization of frames and reporting of dropped frames. 

# Motivation

I needed a way to pull down synchronized video while prototyping a computer vision project. Extreme temporal and spatial precision were less important than getting something reasonable with a minimal budget.
