*Synchronized webcam recording to bootstrap low-cost/early-stage computer vision projects*

</div>

# What it does

Records synchronized frames from multiple webcams, including frame-by-frame time stamp history, real time synchronization of frames and reporting of dropped frames. 

# Motivation

I needed a way to pull down synchronized video while prototyping a computer vision project (https://github.com/mprib/pyxy3d). Extreme temporal and spatial precision were less important than getting something reasonable with a minimal budget.
